# ft_printf 
Description:
ft_printf is one of the projects you will encounter during the core curriculum at the 42school.
The major goal of the project is to discover variadic functions in c such as va_arg or va_copy.
The task is to recode a part of libc's printf. But why reinvent the wheel? Fourty-Two wants its students
to understand what they are using and how it works.
